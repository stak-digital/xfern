# xfern

An open-source media server that has two goals:

1. Don't fall prey to commercial interests ([the freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition#The_Four_Essential_Freedoms_of_Free_Software))
2. Don't aim to be anything more than be the best music server possible ([Worse is better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better))
